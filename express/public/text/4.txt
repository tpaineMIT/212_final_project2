Welcome to the last lesson of the gateway module.
This last lesson will be about tying everything together from the past three lessons and applying what you've learned to real life.
The first thing we'll talk about is machine tending.
There are a ton of machines at machine shops that are really useful for manufacturing, such as mills and lathes.
With that in mind, the first thing I'm going to do is apply the concepts we learned about pick and place to a mill. 
As this box comes down the conveyor, I stop it with the event based programming we learned in module 3, as it passes into the pick up location.
Using my knowledge of waypoints and kinematics, I plan my motion to pick up the box.
I know where I want to place the box according to my encoder values, so I move the box into the CNC mill. 
Lastly, I place the box with a straight motion in the correct orientation and release my gripper.
